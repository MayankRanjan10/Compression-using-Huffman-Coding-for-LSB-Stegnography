# Compression-using-Huffman-Coding-for-LSB-Stegnography
Out  of various types of Stegnography, we have chosen the most common method i.e. LSB Stegnography. Its implementation is simple but it has several limitations. One limitation is that the size of the cover image is much larger than the file concealed within it. In order to overcome this limitation, we attempt to compress the concealed file in the form of an image using Huffman coding method so as to reduce its size and therefore reduce the size required to hide that image.
